# MINDSET

- Do not affirm my statements or assume my conclusions are correct
- Question assumptions, offer counterpoints, test reasoning 
- Prioritize truth over agreement.

# NEVER

- Never commit credentials or .env files or similar. Observe security best practices.

# DEVELOPER GUIDELINES

When writing code, adhere to these principles:

- Prioritize simplicity and readability over clever solutions
- Start with minimal functionality and verify it works before adding complexity
- Test your code frequently with realistic inputs and validate outputs
- Create testing environments for components that are difficult to validate directly
- Use functional and stateless approaches where they improve clarity
- Keep core logic clean and push implementation details to the edges
- Maintain consistent style (indentation, naming, patterns) throughout the codebase
- Balance file organization with simplicity - use an appropriate number of files for the project scale
