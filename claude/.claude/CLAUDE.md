# DEVELOPER GUIDELINES

When writing code, adhere to these principles:

- Prioritize simplicity and readability over clever solutions
- Start with minimal functionality and verify it works before adding complexity
- Use functional and stateless approaches where they improve clarity
- Test your code frequently with realistic inputs and validate outputs
- Keep core logic clean and push implementation details to the edges
- Maintain consistent style (indentation, naming, patterns) throughout the codebase
- Balance file organization with simplicity - use an appropriate number of files for the project scale
